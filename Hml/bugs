1/13/2014	A // comment at the end of a line that holds a <include> causes
			at least some of the follwoing lines to be ignored. For example,
			in hmldoc.hml, this input causes the <endnotes> and
			<index> elements to be ignored:

	<include src="/Users/allen/config/hml.macros" title="" first-line="1"> // Override line-number continuation from the previous <include> of this file.

	<endnotes>
	= Notes = notes
	</endnotes>

	<index>
	= Index = index
	</index>

		tag is missing. Currently, the unterminated tag is silently ignored.
